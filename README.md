# jsout

We all love pycharm for its nice editing capabilities, code navigation, refactoring, debug features and so many more...

But we love as well the Jupyer notebooks that allow nicely inline output of text and images... 
Specially when dealing with machine learning, matplotlib, and opencv.

JSout (Jupyter Style output) allows to capture output from Pycharm or even program running on terminal and display's it in an HTML page where both text and images are show inline..
